# Drone Navigation

## Introduction
The drone navigation package provides a self sufficient navigation unit for a quadcopter navigating through a highly cluttered and unstructured environment. The package contains the following compartments:

* Obstacle detection: Mimics a visual mechanism to create an inverse depth map.
* Obstacle management: Continuously reads updated depth map and creates a point cloud from it.
* Path planner: Uses an obstacle avoidance algorithm to avoid detected obstacles, while sticking to a desired path.
